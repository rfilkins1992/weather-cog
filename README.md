# weather-cog
A cog to be used with Red-DiscordBot
(https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot)

Place 'weather.py' into the "./cogs/" folder.
When you load the cog / start the bot, it will create a blank "settings.json" file in "./data/weather/".
Use the included "settings.json.example" to get your own API key and edit the "settings.json" file.
